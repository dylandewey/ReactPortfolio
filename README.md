## [GitHub](https://github.com/dylandewey/ReactPortfolio.git)
This is my portfolio created in React.  I used an API to pull my information from githubconnection.  I don't love how it works to be honest.  It doesn't pull links or pictures that I insert into github connection.  I have all the pages I need but I would like to change it to be a once page application.  I still need to add more styling to make it more original and mine.  
I still have a lot of work to do on this application and I still have a lot of work to do in learning React.  This will be a good application to spend time making changes and better learning React.  
When I tried to deploy the application in github pages it said it was deployed but nothing shows up on the page.  Then when I would try to run it to the localhost it messed it all up so I had to delete what appeared after the slash in the address bar then it would work.  I think the tutorial I used to make the application must have been older or I missed something so it wasn't working properly.  
I worked with my tutor to try to resolve the issues with no avail.  It actually made things slightly worse.  When I did my last push into github it created another file at the top of the list which is just the same files embedded into another file.  This also made it so my path to the demo gif is much longer than it should be.

Note: When you run it on the localhost be sure the erase the path after the slash.  Then it will pull up.  It is very slow and takes a while for it to finally load.
