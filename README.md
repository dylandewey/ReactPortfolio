This is my portfolio created in React.  I used an API to pull my information from githubconnection.  I don't love how it works to be honest.  It doesn't pull links or pictures that I insert into github connection.  I have all the pages I need but I would like to change it to be a once page application.  I still need to add more styling to make it more original and mine.  
I still have a lot of work to do on this application and I still have a lot of work to do in learning React.  This will be a good application to spend time making changes and better learning React.  
When I tried to deploy the application it said it was deployed but nothing shows up on the page.  Then when I would try to run it to the localhost it messed it all up so I had to delete what appeared after the slash in the address bar then it would work.  I think the tutorial I used to make the application must have been older or I missed something so it wasn't working properly.
